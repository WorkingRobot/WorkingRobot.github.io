                                It's my main project, as of now, that I've worked on for nearly a year. I started on January 7th, 2018 and worked with Discord.NET, a library that allows you to communicate with Discord as a bot. It started off simple, with a standard ping command. Soon after, I started adding a few basic commands, like "hug", "slap", and a few others. Now, it has music functionality, cleverbot, chuck norris quotes, per server configuration, player stats for multiple games, leaderboards, moderation logging, Minecraft server pinging, and many others.

                                It's a project for my CSP class, where myself and a partner work on creating an Android app with App Inventor 2. It was essentially a copy of Doodle Jump, but with Fortnite aspects. The project wasn't meant to be well polished and amazing, but as a satire app, as both of us were incredibly fluent with coding. A few of the "skills" that I learned were working with mobile devices, and game development. My specific role was to work on the textures of the game and fix a few bugs here and there.
