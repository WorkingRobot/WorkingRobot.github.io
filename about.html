                    <h3>Career Goal</h3>
                    I plan to at least help someone in the world in some way or another. It doesn't have to be life-saving or state-of-the-art never seen before technology. I want to make people's lives better or easier, whether it be easier communication, game development, or simpler management. My plans for achieving this goal is to finish high school, complete my Bachelor's or Master's Computer Science degree, and settle down at a company where I can make decent money, while also working on side projects, if I have time available. I don't have a craving for money, but I'd like to at least have a nice house, and not eat Top Ramen every day.

                    <h3>Strengths and Qualities</h3>
                    I see myself as kind of a perfectionist at times, which has its ups and downs. I am usually creative, artistic, flexible, talkative, very self-motivated, and extremely adaptable.

                    <h3>Achievements</h3>
                    I've had Honor Roll in all quarters except 2 since 6th grade. I participate in a few clubs, like the Technology Seminar Club, and the Programming Club. One of my major accomplishments would be creating, establishing, and constantly working on GoatBot, a Discord bot with many different features, and serves to more than 200,000 users and 3,000 servers.

                    <h3>Abilities and Work Skills</h3>
                    I've been working and dealing with code ever since 3rd grade and haven't looked back since. Throughout that time, I've learned numerous things. For example, I know how to debug a program quickly and efficiently without getting tangled up in debug statements and service downtime.
